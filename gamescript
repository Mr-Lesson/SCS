Scene 1 – Journey to California / Camp with Josiah

Narrator:
The year is 1851. Mexico has just lost the war, and the United States has taken California. Settlers from all over now flock west, chasing the smell of gold. You walk beside your wagon headed for the Sierra Nevada, hoping for a chance to stake a claim to find some gold.

Narrator:
As you walk, you breathe a smile of relief: after months of grueling travel, you were almost at California.

Narrator:
The people you’ve met traveling the California Trail all said the same thing: This is the place of opportunity. This is where you will have the chance to make the money you need to make you and your family rich.

Narrator:
You give yourself a small smile. This may be the place where your dreams can come true. A place of equal opportunity: where every man could have an equal shot at getting rich. But you must remain vigilant: despite all that those have said to you, you have no idea what you’re getting into.

Narrator:
As you walk, you encounter Josiah, a freedman you’ve encountered many times on your way to California, setting up camp. As it’s getting late, you decide to do the same.

Narrator:
After you finish, you begin chatting with Josiah about the land ahead.

Josiah:
"Back East, I worked fields I would never own. I was just property. Here, they say the land is free. You think it’ll be free for someone like me?"

Player Choices:

Of course it is free
Josiah: "I hope you’re right. It would mean the world."

Not sure
Josiah: "No one really knows till we are there. But hope keeps folks moving."

I do not care about what others think
Josiah: "If you only care for yourself, you will find out how lonely this land is." He pulls his coat tight and looks away.

Scene 2 – River Valley / Meeting Elias

Narrator:
After some time, you finally reach a river valley crowded with tents and rough shacks. As you look around, you see the Gold Rush is in full swing: Americans like you from the East, European fortune seekers, Chilean and Sonoran miners, Kanakas from the Pacific, and growing numbers of Chinese laborers work the banks.

Narrator:
The hills bear scars where hydraulic hoses and picks have torn the soil. You see the remnants of what appear to be native villages along the river burnt to ashes.

Narrator:
A broad shouldered man with a faded militia jacket walks up to you.

Elias:
"The name’s Elias. When I rode in 49, this valley was full of camps. Governor said they wanted to make it safe for you settlers. We took care of that. State paid us per head."

Player Choices:

Approve
Elias: "Good. Folks with a clear mind get rewarded." (He claps you on the shoulder)

Ask about the villages
Elias: "You worry too much. Keep your head down and stake your claim."

Ask for advice
Elias: "Find water and stay near it. If you can, keep your claim where others won't bother you."

Scene 3 – Meeting Aiyana

Narrator:
As you examine the banks, a small group approaches. At their head walks Aiyana, a Maidu woman, carrying woven baskets. You see those behind her carrying items foraged from around the river.

Aiyana:
"Hello, I am Aiyana. The men who came before you cut down our oaks, drove off our game, and turned our water into mud. Our dead still reside here. Whatever we can find, we bring here to sell. Please, will you buy something from us?"

Player Choices:

Buy and listen
Aiyana: "Thank you. We remember those who treat us with care." She offers you a small woven bead in thanks.

Dismiss her
Narrator: Aiyana leaves quietly. You hear the murmur of the crowd.

Reassure her but do not buy
Aiyana: "Words are lighter than deeds." She folds her hands and walks on.

Scene 4 – Courthouse / Solomon Arrives

Narrator:
Having finally found a place to claim, you begin trying to find gold, but fail. As night falls, you head to the small settlement put together for those searching for gold. You eat and fall asleep, thinking about Aiyana.

Narrator:
As you wake up, you see some new notices being set up outside the courthouse.

Narrator:
You walk towards them, reading the following:

Act for the Government and Protection of Indians: By order of the State of California, settlers are authorized to employ indigenous persons under binding contracts and to assume custody of Indian minors as necessary for their care and protection. All such arrangements must be registered within the county.

Section 14 of the Criminal Proceedings Act: No Indian or Black person shall be permitted to give evidence in any case involving a white citizen.

Foreign Miner’s Tax: Effective immediately, all foreign miners are required to pay a monthly fee of $20 dollars to mine. Persons originating from China, Mexico, Chile, or other foreign countries must present proof of payment on request or vacate their claims.

Narrator:
Inside, you see a hearing underway. A Californio man waves land grants written in Spanish while a white man argues that under American law, that grant is void.

Judge:
"Under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, valid Mexican grants may be recognized only when proven under the procedure of the United States. This court follows American law, and that law requires proper documentation in English."

Californio (through interpreter):
"This land fed our family before either flag flew above it. We hold a grant signed by the Mexican Governor. Our cattle grazed here long before the Americans arrived. Must our home disappear because our papers are different?"

Judge:
"Your claim lacks the survey and documentation required by the Land Act of 1851. Your grant is not sufficient for recognition in this court. The present settler has demonstrated occupation and improvement under U.S. standards, thus the claim is awarded to him."

Narrator:
You step back into the crowd and see Josiah, alongside the family of the Mexican and some white settlers, watching the trial. Josiah looks to you, almost expecting you to say something.

Narrator:
The judge continues and the crowd murmurs. At the edge of the courthouse a white settler stands with a man who looks worn and watchful.

Solomon:
"I am called Solomon. I am to accompany this settler."

Narrator:
Solomon is a Black arrivant who had been brought along to work. He stands quietly, watching the proceedings and the exchanges.

Narrator:
Josiah looks over to you, his expression a mixture of fatigue and resolve. Aiyana watches from the edge of the crowd, holding a small basket.

Narrator:
Solomon is now part of the party that will be moving on. Josiah speaks quietly to you and to Solomon before you all move away from the courthouse.

Scene 5 – Coercion

Narrator:
After the courthouse, you notice the settler who won the case speaking quietly to Josiah in a low voice.

Narrator:
The settler's tone hardens and you hear him insist Josiah accompany him to work as a hired hand — or else.

Narrator:
Josiah looks shaken; you realize the settler is coercing him into labor despite the court's earlier decision.

Settler:
"You saw how the law works. You will work this claim or you will be turned out to the road. That is the choice."

Josiah:
"I have no papers to fight with. I will do what I must to survive."

Narrator:
Solomon stands nearby, silent and watchful.

Player Choices:

Confront the settler
Player: "You cannot treat a man that way."
Narrator: The settler glares but loosens his grip. Josiah gives a look of gratitude.

Offer Josiah a chance to work with you instead
Player: "Work with me — I will pay."
Josiah: "I would be thankful."
Narrator: Aiyana watches approvingly.

Say nothing and walk away
Narrator: You walk away silently, convincing yourself survival requires caution.

Scene 6 – Josiah, Solomon, and Aiyana Reflection

Josiah:
"We have come a long way and things are changing fast. I will keep an eye out for you."

Solomon:
"I will do what I must, but I wish freedom had come sooner."

Narrator:
Aiyana approaches with a small woven basket and offers some food. The three of you share a quiet moment before deciding what to do next.

Narrator:
Together, you plan your next steps in this unsettled land.

Player Choices:

Continue to the settlement

Offer to help Solomon find work
Solomon: "Thank you. I will try and see what I can do. Careful, not all men here have honor."

Part ways for now

Scene 7 – Saloon / Expedition

Narrator:
One evening, miners and townspeople gather outside a saloon. Elias sits on a crate, reading a notice.

Elias:
"County Supervisors have authorized funds for a new expedition. A band in the hills has been accused of stock theft and threatening settlers. The state will reimburse expenses and those who bring in hostiles."

Elias:
"Player, your standing on land men like us cleared. Are you riding with us?"

Player Choices:

Join fully
Narrator: "You swear to ride with them at dawn, accepting their terms."

Refuse
Narrator: "You step back and refuse. Some men sneer, others nod in quiet respect."

Join but will not shoot unless needed
Narrator: "You join the expedition but promise to avoid killing when possible."

Scene 8 – Battle / Hills

Narrator:
At dawn, you ride into the hills with Josiah and several others. You find the camp filled with small shelters.

Narrator:
Gunfire erupts. People scatter. What will you do?

Player Choices:

Fire at a fleeing figure
Narrator: Smoke and screaming fill your ears as the settlement burns. You ride back to the men; Josiah clasps your shoulder with a savage grimace.

Fire and purposefully miss
Narrator: You pull the trigger but deliberately miss. Chaos remains. Men scowl — they were expecting profit, not mercy.

Shield someone physically
Narrator: You leap between a fleeing woman and a shooter. The bullet grazes your arm. A few escape because of you.

Scene 9 – Final Campfire / Reflection

Narrator:
Years have passed. The Gold Rush has ended, leaving memories, consequences, and fortunes made or lost.

Narrator:
During your time here, you accumulated [Gold Score] gold.

Narrator:
Your actions have left their mark: morality score [Morality Score].

Good Ending Example (if player sided with settlers fully):

"Around the campfire, you sit with Josiah, Aiyana, Solomon, and a few others. Your pockets are full, and your claim secured."

Josiah: "You prospered, but some of us paid the price for it."

Aiyana: "The land is safer now, but the stories of loss linger."

"Ironically, your choices ensured your own success, while communities you could have helped remain scarred."

Bad Ending Example (if player helped others):

"The campfire flickers as you sit among Josiah, Aiyana, and Solomon, faces tired but grateful."

Josiah: "You stood with us, even when it meant risk and loss."

Aiyana: "The land is harder for us still, but your actions gave some hope."

"You sacrificed gold, comfort, and safety to protect others, and the valley still bears the scars of what you tried to prevent."

Mixed Ending Example:

"The campfire crackles as you sit with Josiah, Aiyana, and Solomon, and the other settlers you rode with."

Josiah: "You sometimes helped, sometimes stayed back. Your heart was torn."

Aiyana: "You did not fully stand with us, yet spared more than you took."

"You gained some wealth and security, but the consequences of your choices linger in the shadows."

Narrator:
=== THE END ===
Your final gold: [Gold Score]. Morality: [Morality Score].
